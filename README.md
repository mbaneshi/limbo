  <summary>What is OLTP? </summary>
  
  **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)** systems are designed to handle real-time transactional data, typically in applications requiring high-volume, short, and fast transactions. These systems support operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting data records in real-time.

  ### Key Characteristics of OLTP:
  - **High Transaction Throughput**: Optimized to handle a large number of quick transactions.
  - **Real-Time Processing**: Transactions are processed instantly.
  - **ACID Properties**: Ensures data consistency and reliability.
  - **Relational Databases**: Typically uses relational databases to maintain integrity.

  ### Where OLTP Systems Shine:
  OLTP systems are ideal for applications that need quick, reliable data processing and integrity. They are commonly used in:
  - **Financial Systems** (e.g., banks, stock trading)
  - **Retail Systems** (e.g., point-of-sale)
  - **Reservation Systems** (e.g., airlines, hotel bookings)
  - **E-commerce** (e.g., order management)
  - **Supply Chain** (e.g., inventory updates)

  ### Real-World Example: Bank Transaction System
  - **Deposit**: User deposits money; the system immediately updates the balance.
  - **Withdrawal**: The system checks funds and deducts money in real-time.
  - **Fund Transfer**: Money is moved between accounts instantly, ensuring consistency.

  These operations must be fast, consistent, and reliable, making them typical of OLTP systems.

  <summary>How Does SQLite Fit Into OLTP? </summary>

  **SQLite** is a lightweight, self-contained relational database that is fully compatible with OLTP systems, particularly for smaller-scale, embedded, or mobile applications.

  ### Why SQLite Works for OLTP:
  - **Lightweight and Embeddable**: SQLite doesn’t require a separate server; it is embedded directly into the application.
  - **Fast for Small-Scale Transactions**: It’s optimized for quick, small-scale read/write operations, ideal for mobile apps and smaller systems.
  - **ACID Compliant**: Ensures data integrity even in case of failure, making it ideal for transaction systems.
  - **Zero Configuration**: Easy to deploy with no need for complex setups, making it suitable for small applications.
  - **Concurrency Control**: While SQLite uses a simpler locking mechanism, it is sufficient for smaller-scale applications.
  - **Portability**: SQLite databases are stored in a single file, making them portable and easy to back up.

  ### Real-World Example: Mobile Banking App
  - **User Actions**: Check balances, make payments, view transaction history.
  - **Local Database**: SQLite stores user data and transaction records on the device.
  - **Transaction Integrity**: When a transaction happens (e.g., money transfer), SQLite ensures consistency and reliability.
  - **Offline Support**: The app can continue working offline, syncing with the central server once connected again.

  ### When to Use SQLite for OLTP:
  - **Small-Scale Applications**: Great for light to medium transaction volumes.
  - **Mobile Apps**: Ideal for apps requiring local transactional data storage.
  - **Embedded Systems**: For IoT or devices with limited resources needing local databases.

## Features

* In-process OLTP database engine library
* Asynchronous I/O support with `io_uring`
* SQLite compatibility ([status](COMPAT.md))
  * SQL dialect support
  * File format support
  * SQLite C API
* JavaScript/WebAssembly bindings (_wip_)


## Getting Started

### CLI

Install `limbo` with:

```shell 
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/penberg/limbo/releases/latest/download/limbo-installer.sh | sh
```

Then use the SQL shell to create and query a database:

```console
$ limbo database.db
Limbo v0.0.6
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
limbo> CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT);
limbo> INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'alice');
limbo> INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, 'bob');
limbo> SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

### JavaScript (wip)

Installation:

```console
npm i limbo-wasm
```

Example usage:

```js
import { Database } from 'limbo-wasm';

const db = new Database('sqlite.db');
const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users');
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```

### Python (wip)

```console
pip install pylimbo
```

Example usage:

```python
import limbo

con = limbo.connect("sqlite.db")
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
print(res.fetchone())
```

## Developing

Build and run `limbo` cli: 

```shell 
cargo run --package limbo --bin limbo database.db
```

Run tests:

```console
cargo test
```

Test coverage report:

```
cargo tarpaulin -o html
```

Run benchmarks:

```console
cargo bench
```

Run benchmarks and generate flamegraphs:

```console
echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
cargo bench --bench benchmark -- --profile-time=5
```

## FAQ

### How is Limbo different from libSQL?

Limbo is a research project to build a SQLite compatible in-process database in Rust with native async support. The libSQL project, on the other hand, is an open source, open contribution fork of SQLite, with focus on production features such as replication, backups, encryption, and so on. There is no hard dependency between the two projects. Of course, if Limbo becomes widely successful, we might consider merging with libSQL, but that is something that will be decided in the future.
